MILESTONE PROJECT TWO - USER INTERACTIVE 
# Haikyū! - anime series player cards and quiz

#### This project features a website based on the manga and anime series Haikyū!, featuring the teams that are important to the plot of the story. Interacting with the panels on the homepage will bring the user to information about the teams, starting line-up player cards and team quiz.

# User Story 

## Visitor to the website 
* I am a fan of the anime and I want to test my knowledge of the teams.
* I watched the anime and can't match the player's name to the player's face. 

### These goals are accomplished via: 
* Player cards in the panel feature an image, name, position and year of each starting line-up player for the teams.
* A three-choice multiple question quiz for each team.

# 1. Strategy
* The target users to this website are fans or would-be fans. 
* The website should be visually appealing - simple yet fun.
* Player cards and team information should provide some leads to the quiz answers.

# 2. Scope
* Panels to host the players cards and team information.
* Information in the panels help with answering questions in the quiz.

# 3. Structure
* Consistant features on the homepage and quiz pages are:
    * logo at the top 
    * site storyline below the logo
* Essentially just two pages - homepage and quiz pages

# 4. Skeleton 
* No header or footer navigation buttons on homepage
* Logo on quiz page is clickable and returns user to homepage

* Wireframes:
